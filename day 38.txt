The @EnableAsync annotation switches on Springâ€™s ability to run @Async methods in a background thread pool.
 
@ASync for making the class asynchronous .

>> Data integrity is main the main contraint

>>  For composite servicew we use Syncronous channel

>>  For composite micro serices syn is best

>>  Thread is a task( work )

>>  threads work on Asycnronius .

>>  A processor can have as many threads

>>  Every process has name and id .Os will give some  vey key :value)

>>   which ever class has main class 

Threads are of two types :

>> predefined is under control of JVM  

>> user defined is under control of user

>> 1. extend thread
>> 2. implements runable 

>> Runable is  called as functional interfernce : A function with single abstract is called as "Functional interferences ""
