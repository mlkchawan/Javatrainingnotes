      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~        HIBERNATE          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>  Hibernate supports RDBMS databases like : sql ,postgre sql, oracle etc.

>>  sql queries are dependent on db .that is one drawback 

>> cache memory is used for faster retrieval of data from the        database.

>> After giving the sql query it will do parsing in the background 

>> In the backend it has "sql query execution plan"

>>  cached Rowsets and cached result set

>>  Cascading rules 

>>  Relationships

>>  ORM  ; ORM ------->> convert pojo class to table and vice versa
=================================================================

>>  table creation should be automatic

>>  JPA  --- is a specification;

>> SPECIFICATIONS : Are set of rules and regulations

>> Hibernate is the  implementor for JPA Specifications
>> ibatis ,toplink is the compitotors to them .

>>  hibernate is a vendor who implemented the JPA Specifications
       its open source

>>  apache has its own JPA Specificationa .its name is APache persistent API

>>   Hibernate is giving  hql (Hibernate query language ) --- hql is also independent

>> cache is provided by hql .

>> cache giving ---1st level ,2nd level caching (3rd party caching)

>>  3rd partry caching ---memcache ,EH Cache ,swarn cache,Hazelcast,Reddis ...........etc

>> its providing relationship

>> its Supports keys,  ORM , Supports Collections ,

>> hibernate ogm (Object grid Mapper)  you can push/pull the data from db it implemented using mongo DB

>> we can move data from one db to another db using dump,later import into new db


TO WORK ON HIBERNATES WE HAVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>  hibernate cfg xml file
>>  pojo class
>>  Mapping file.xml
>>  Test class
==================================================================

1)Create a config object and load cfg metadata into memory.

2)Using config object,get session factory object.

3)from sessionfactory object,fetch session and open that
session with database.

4)Once connection is established,initiate tx.

5)perform db operations

6)tx shld be commited

7)close session with db.
