ES7
ES8
=====================================================
Front -End techies are  : Reacts JS,Reactnative ,Angular ,Backbone ,VUEJS   etc.

Above Framework will use node js capabilities too perform Scaffolding and for writing /running codes .

Without Node Js nothing is possible in front end 

Node js is Evironment 

In java script  CI/CD servers    --------- we use jenkins /team city 

Java -----has ----maven 
Javascript -------has --------NPM Node package manager  ( part of the Node JS ).
