HQL From: HQL From is same as select clause in SQL . We can also create alias such as from Employee emp or from Employee as emp.

HQL Join : HQL supports inner join, left outer join, right outer join and full join. For example, select e.name, a.city from Employee e INNER JOIN e.address a. In this query, Employee class should have a variable named address. We will look into it in the example code.

Aggregate Functions: HQL supports commonly used aggregate functions such as count(*), count(distinct x), min(), max(), avg() and sum().

Expressions: HQL supports arithmetic expressions (+, -, *, /), binary comparison operators (=, >=, <=, <>, !=, like), logical operations (and, or, not) etc.

HQL also supports ordre by and group by clauses.

HQL also supports sub-queries just like SQL queries.

HQL supports DDL, DML and executing store procedures too.
