Steps to create maven project :

[setting.xml files
 proxy information
 commom dependencies informati
 corporate repo info:Ip address,portno,username,pssword
 plugins etc ]

>> create a maven project
>> Add spring dependencies
>> clean install the maven project nder goals: clean install{everytime}
>> Create a new java package and java beans class
>> create a applicationcontent.xml file under src/resources
>> fill the xml file as per the requirements
>> < bean id="abb" class="">
< property name ="aa" value=22/>
</bean>
>> create a test class or main class
>> initiate IOC container in main class using " ClassPAthxmlApplicationcontext"
>> get the bean and call the required getter methods  
>> container should be shoutdowned for which we are caling "shutdownhook"


>> whenever ioc goes shutdwon it will never go forced shutdown when we using shutdownhook
 >> it will clean up the resources in progress/release the memory
  >> through context we are caling the shutdown methods


>> In maven when we want to give dynamic values we give ${key}
>> 

=============================================================

>>  Create a project (we can create in two types quickstart[create dessktop],webapp [creates web app])
>>  "scaffolding" the process of creating the project based on requirements.
>>  when we creating project on basis of scaffolding we need to follow rules
