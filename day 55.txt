======================= Day 51 ==========================

>> Every sevre instace will have ip addreses 

>> ex : 22.22.2..22.2.

whwn we restrat the server instance ip address will chnag automatically in cloud . For permanent IP Address we need to use Elastic IP .Elastic Ip will never chnage even if we retsart server 

EIP =====are chargable 




docker -v

sudo yum install git

sudo yum install maven 

sudo yum install java1.8.0 


=======================================================

Hypervisor     =======infraS

Containers   :

Container engine

container has only one OS 

it doesnt support Windows .it supports only linux  

Amazon linux is what we using now 

WSLT ------errors 


Docker VS Container

=======================================================

		DOCKER ::

>VM are heavy weight because of Hypervisor and evry app will have its own o/s.

>In docker,we dint have hypervisor,we do have "Container engine.
>Container enginer is responsible for controlling the lifecycle of container.

>In docker ,Container engine is main component that is responsible to run ur app.

>Docker uses "Dockerfile" to run java app.SO,evry java app shld be embedded with Docker file.

>When we use docker,first we need to convert your code to image(like jar).To do this we need to build project first using docker build.

>Once converted,we need to run the image,so that that image will be executed in container.Other wise without run we cann view the output.(docker run <> <>)
 
docker ps---to view current running containers
docker images---to view current images in docker
docker run--to run an image to container
docker build---will convert ur code to image
 
>>In docker any app shld run in container ie whether it is .net,python,java.....
>Like Maven repo,for docker,we have docker hub.
>We can also push our own userdefined images to docker hub using docker push.
>Docker file will not have any extension.
file shld be like below:
Dockerfile
>docker stop <containerid> will stop ur running container.

Docker files consists of instructions that shld be executed by your docker engine before converting to image.
======================================================
Ec2--->Docker---->Container(Springboot)
 
Containers uses VM concepts on backend.To install docker software on Laptops or computers,we need to first install VM.
 
>To install docker,we need to enable virtualization/Hyper-v at OS level.

=======================================================

Maven =============Build 
Github -------------------code Reposiotory 
AWS -----------------------

Code Commit ------------Github 
Code Build --------------Maven Build 
code Deployment --------EC2 
Code pipeline =========AWS
Code quality =========Code Guru
To store Code or any files we can also use ,Aws S3 bucket
Aws had come up with tool kit for eclipse or for developers 

using these toolkit we can push/deploy/writre /modify code directly from IDE like Eclipse Vscode intellij
