=====================  day 50 =========================


in Jenkins 

1. We cannot create roles directly 

2. we cannot create bulk users at a time 

3.As 1 and 2 points are bot possible we can assign permissions to users 
but if we want to achieve we need to relay on security plugins in jenkins like  matrix Authorization Startegy 

LDAP + JENKINS   [LDAP is a Server]

SSO  --single sign oll   ===>> through sso we can access multiple sites using single sign in like google accnt sign to all apps like yputube ,facebook etc 

Token =====this token will act as authenticator between applications 

when we deal with secuirty we have to deal with AUTHORIZATION and AUTHENTICATION

Every Token will have its exoiry time 

Once token get expired we cannot continue with the same token need to fetch new tokens from issuer 

To deisgn App using SSO ,we need to have use below tools frameworks :

OAKTa framework is Industry top compitetor as of now 

1.  Oauth 2.0
2.  SAPL          [ complicated but more secure and costly ]
3.KEBEROUS 
4.JSoN Tokens etc


where we use  tokens it has start and end time to it
like having amazon prime account means we can acces amazon ,fresh ,grocierires


ROLE BASED  AUTHORIZATION STFRATEGY :


BY  Default will act as  master node. MAStER will have a original data 

In projecs devops engineer creates acluster for jenkins

cluster means it is agroup of machine /servers/terminals /node reate 

to Create a ckuster we need to have atlest ine manchine.

		AWS  CLOUD 
	         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

why ?



AWS provides cloud Computing services .



IAM : Identity Access Management 

From IAM we create users ,and also create or delete policies ,roles ,creation,assigning roles , assign polices,delete,role creation,assigning roles,Password rules creation,passsword settings,aws user creation reports




		EC2

Elastic Cloud Computing ----EC2

AMI ----Amazon Machine Image 

Aws had modified existing opensource operating systems and released into the market as AMI

AWS linux AMi 

AWS need to learn Linux 

VM-----interent is mandatory ,IP Addres is also ,port no: , Storage ,Security 

To perform any operations on cloud are we need to have atleast  one VPC.

VPC gives  below :

1. IP Address assigining 

2. Routing to right node 

3.port no 

4.subnet address

5.security rules/firewalls ....etc

Inbound -------------Outbound 

123.45.66.77

> Every Protocal in networking will have port no 

htpp = ==8080
https====84443
FTP =====
SMTP =====
AFTP ======
POP  =======


To access any VM from any cloud we can follow below ways

1. using browser 

2. using putty /putty gentools 

3. using AWS API

4.using AWS CLI

EC2/EBS/Code commit ,code ,build


EBS ====stands for Elastic block store 

want to install jenkins on AWS EC2


frontend ------EBS

backend in ----- Docker 

Database ------ AWS mysql server
