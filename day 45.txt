	Conventions of Using State in React:
 
The state of a component should prevail throughout its lifetime, thus we
 must first have some initial state, to do so we should define the State in 
the constructor of the componentâ€™s class.

The state should never be updated explicitly. React uses an observable 
object as the state that observes what changes are made to the state and
 helps the component behave accordingly.

React provides its own method setState(). setState() method takes a single 
parameter and expects an object which should contain the set of values to
 be updated. Once the update is done the method implicitly calls the
 render() method to repaint the page. Hence, the correct method of 
updating the value of a state will be similar to the code below.
 
State updates should be independent. The state object of a component 
may contain multiple attributes and React allows to use setState() function
 to update only a subset of those attributes as well as using multiple setState

() methods to update each attribute value independently.
The only time we are allowed to define the state explicitly is in the constructor to provide the initial state.

>>State is not applicable for the componensts that we create using functionc. state works only for components that we are using class
but from the lastest react version.ie from 16 version 0n words works even for functional approach we  can achieve state using "hooks  concepts

>>To change state values dynamically we need to use below method:
